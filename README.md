Polynom Project:

This project include two main classes of polynomial monom. Includes capabilities for initialization, creation, addition, multiplication, derivative calculation, present graph and more.

Monom Class:

This class represents a simple "Monom" of shape a*x^b, where a is a real number and a is an integer (summed a none negative). Support operations as: Create new monom object and set the monom coefficient and the monom power. Create new monom object by other monom object (copy him). Get the monom coefficient and powers functions. Add, multiply, subtraction, derivative, f (return f(x) value) and equals (return true if two monoms are the same) functions.

Polynom Class:

This class represents a polynom. Support operations as: Create an empty polynom. Create polynom object by type the polynom as a string. Create new polynom object by other polynom object (copy him). Add monom, add polynom, multiply, subtraction, derivative, area under x axis, is-zero (return true if the polynom equal to zero), copy (copy the polynom to a new one), iterator (return monoms iterator of the polynom), f (return f(x) value), equals (return true if two polynoms are the same), root (find the root using the crossover method) and area (compute Riemann's integral) functions

Polynom Graph Class:

Present the polynom graph on the axis of numbers in [x0, x1] range, the extreme points highlighted in red and their values printed on the console.

Note that the jar file "gral-core-0.11" must be added before use this class!
